# EHT-analyze: MATLAB Analysis Suite

MATLAB code for EHT (Engineered Heart Tissue) post motion tracking and force analysis.

---

## Quick Start

### 1. Motion Tracking

Track post positions from image sequences using `EHT_motion_tracker.m`.

```matlab
template_path = 'C:/Templates/';     % Where to save/load templates
data_path = 'C:/RawData/';           % Folder with video folders
result_path = 'C:/Results/';         % Where to save results
perform_annotation = true;           % Set to false if templates already exist

EHT_motion_tracker(template_path, data_path, result_path, perform_annotation);
```

**Input folders must be named:** `Acquire-EHT_WellID_PacingRate`
- Example: `Acquire-EHT_C3_0`, `Acquire-EHT_C3_60`, `Acquire-EHT_C3_120`

**Templates:**
- The tracker looks for video-specific templates first (`Pos0/templates/`).
- If not found, it looks for well-based templates in `template_path`.
- If `perform_annotation` is true, it will ask you to draw boxes around posts for each well.

> [!WARNING]
> **Template Drawing Protocol:**
> When drawing templates, crop the box *as tightly as possible* around the upper or lower tip of the bare post. Do not include large blocks of background tissue. `normxcorr2` tracks the average motion of the entire drawn block. If background tissue is included, it will falsely dampen the force waveform amplitude, which will artificially shift the C50, R50, and UV timing metrics.



### 2. Force Analysis

Calculate force and beat metrics using `multi_pacing_analysis.m`.

```matlab
% Run this after motion tracking
multi_pacing_analysis
```

This script automatically:
1.  Finds the most recent results file in the `Results` folder.
2.  Analyzes each well at each pacing rate.
3.  Generates figures and result text files.

**Output:**
- `[Well]_[Rate]BPM_temp_result.txt` - Force metrics
- `[Well]_[Rate]BPM_temp_fig.fig` - Force vs Time plot

## Configuration

Configuration is handled by `EHT_config.m`.

| Parameter | Value | Description |
|-----------|-------|-------------|
| pixel_size | 67 | Pixels per mm (Camera calibration) |
| post_radius | 1.0 | Post radius in mm (Legacy value) |
| diastolic_distance | 8.0 | Resting distance between posts in mm |
| tissue_height | 12.0 | Tissue height in mm |
| youngs_modulus | 1.7 | PDMS Young's modulus (MPa) |

*Note: `EHT_config_corrected.m` is available for physically accurate force calculations (uses post_radius=0.5mm).*
